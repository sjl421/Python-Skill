DESCRIPTION
    Machine learning module for Python
    ==================================
    
    sklearn is a Python module integrating classical machine
    learning algorithms in the tightly-knit world of scientific Python
    packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).
    
    It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning problems
    that are accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts:
    machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and engineering.
    
    See http://scikit-learn.org for complete documentation.

FUNCTIONS
    clone(estimator, safe=True)
        Constructs a new estimator with the same parameters.
        
        Clone does a deep copy of the model in an estimator
        without actually copying attached data. It yields a new estimator
        with the same parameters that has not been fit on any data.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        estimator : estimator object, or list, tuple or set of objects
            The estimator or group of estimators to be cloned
        
        safe : boolean, optional
            If safe is false, clone will fall back to a deep copy on objects
            that are not estimators.
