DESCRIPTION
    pandas - a powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python
    =====================================================================
    
    **pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
    structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both
    easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
    doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
    the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data
    analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on
    its way toward this goal.
    
    Main Features
    -------------
    Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:
    
      - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating
        point data
      - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and
        higher dimensional objects
      - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can  be explicitly aligned
        to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let
        `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in
        computations
      - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine
        operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data
      - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python
        and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects
      - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large
        data sets
      - Intuitive merging and joining data sets
      - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
      - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)
      - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),
        Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5
        format
      - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency
        conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions,
        date shifting and lagging, etc.
